# -CS10-Projects
Contains Java projects from CS10 (Problem Solving via Oriented-programming) at Dartmouth College.

Pset 6 contains files for a project that connects users across a shared network to collaborate on a drawing, in a sort of bare-bones Google Docs way.

To run the program, download all files, run SketchServer first, then SketchServerCommunicator, then run Editor.java. Any collaborator should run the same files but should change their IP address to the IP address of the host. This way, both users can collaborate over the same local network.
